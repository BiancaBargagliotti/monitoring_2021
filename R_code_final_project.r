# I want to assess the consequences on vegetation of fires happened in the Amazon forest during the summer of 2019
# In order to do this, I consider the NDVI, to asses the greenness of the area, and the FCover, to quantify the spatial extent of the vegetation before, during and after the fires of 2019.

# The data used are downloaded from Copernicus 

# First, I set the working directory
